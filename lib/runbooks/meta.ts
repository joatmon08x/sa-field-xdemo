A shared helper may live under lib/. Each worker starts with clean context; the dispatch prompt must name the files, the helper, and the constraint.

- Worker: enable Accept / Decline on app/disputes/[id]/page.tsx.

Launch the dispute-verifier subagent as the verifier: it checks tests/suggested-credit-api.test.ts (or npm test), confirms both suggested-credit routes still work, POSTs accept/decline against dsp_1043, and loads http://127.0.0.1:43173/disputes/dsp_1043.
