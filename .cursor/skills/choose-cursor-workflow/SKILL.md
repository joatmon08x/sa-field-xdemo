# Choose a demo track and workflow

The workflows are not interchangeable. Pick on the shape of the work: how many pieces, and what tells you it is done. You still review the result.

## Pick a track

- **101** — Ask → Plan → Agent, then `/model`, `/debug`, `/create-rule`, and `/create-skill` (customer email update, change model, fix a failing test, add a project rule and skill).
- **201** — deck-aligned orientation, customization, models, Cloud Agents, Automations, trust, then `/multitask`, `/loop`, `/autopilot`, or `/orchestrate`.
- **Advanced** — deeper Ledgerly scenarios. Starts with the Cursor CLI primer, then adds `/goal` for a durable product objective.

Every beat is independent. If the user names a command, jump directly to it.

## Choose the command

1. **Many independent pieces?**
   - Yes → `/multitask` — hands over **breadth**.
2. **Just waiting or re-checking?**
   - Yes → `/loop` — hands over **time**.
3. **An open PR must become merge-ready?**
   - Yes → `/autopilot` — hands over **the pull request**. This is the current name for the deck's `/babysit`.
4. **One long-lived objective with a clear finish?**
   - Yes → `/goal` — hands over **the objective**. Advanced track only.
5. **The objective must first be decomposed and staffed?**
   - Yes → `/orchestrate` — hands over **the plan itself**.

Rule of thumb: use `/autopilot` only when there is a real pull request — if there is none, stop and say so. Use `/goal` for a durable objective that is not merely PR supervision. Use `/orchestrate` when the plan itself must be delegated. `/loop` must start with `/loop` so the slash command fires.

## What does not change

The human reviews the result and decides what ships. These commands change how much runs without sitting there, not who is accountable.

## Use the matching prompt

Prompts live in `lib/workflows/meta.ts` and as copy-paste blocks on `/workflows`. Use the matching `prompt` verbatim. Do not invent another catalog price.

| Command | Ledgerly target |
| --- | --- |
| `/multitask` | Four API surfaces via `dispatch-subagents` + `api-instrumenter` |
| `/loop` | `POST` then poll `/api/demo/job` |
| `/autopilot` | Current branch's open PR until merge-ready; the human merges |
| `/goal` | Dispute resolution until tests and `dsp_1043` pass |
| `/orchestrate` | Same outcome, planner/workers/`dispute-verifier` (plugin + `CURSOR_API_KEY`) |
